# Install private packages

Of course, [Standard Registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry) doesn't include private packages.
`private packages` are tools hosted in private GitHub Repositories.

To install private packages, you have to write Registry Configuration by yourself.

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `AQUA_GITHUB_TOKEN` is required.

About how to write Registry Configuration, please see [Add Packages to Registry](add-registry.md).
